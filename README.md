# illacceptanything

> The project where [literally](https://xkcd.com/725/)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

 * No porn.
 * Nothing illegal.
 * Can't violate GitHub terms of service.
 * Don't mess with the LICENSE file - we kind of need that intact!
 * Don't be a [dick](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/blob/master/data/dickbutt.dickbutt), or any other copulatory organ. This includes:
    - [Trying](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/463) [to](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/498) [delete](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/545) [everything](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/308) [in](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/259) [the](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/131) [repository](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/396).
    - [Uploading](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/423) [malicious](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/404) [code](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/492)
    - s/anything/nothing/: [#292](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/292) [#340](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything/pull/340)
    - Also, please refrain from uploading extremely large files, since those can make cloning the repository impossible for other contributors.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as illacceptanything, is in fact, GNU/illacceptanything, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus illacceptanything. illacceptanything is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “illacceptanything”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a illacceptanything, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. illacceptanything is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. illacceptanything is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with illacceptanything added, or GNU/illacceptanything. All the so-called “illacceptanything” distributions are really distributions of GNU/illacceptanything.
